oerp_shipping_api_usps
======================

My version of the OpenERP shipping_api_usps module by NovaPoint Group LLC.

One of the biggest differences in this version is that labels get sent to an EPL2 printer attached to the server instead of PDFs being generated.
Eventually the printer_proxy module I wrote should be integrated with this.
